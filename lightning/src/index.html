                    This text is found inside the wrapping <code>div</code> that intializes the lightning APP. In a real case scenario inside marketplace, we need the app to be wrapping up this content, as this content could be WooCommerce checkout template, as we want to extend its functionality/UI with components. Sadly, lightning does seem to sopport this.

                    Boostrap was not being able to be loaded from <code>/node_modules</code> had to use a CDN.

                <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
                    Boostrap's clases (.i.e. <code>.container</code>) are being bypassed inside lightning (meaning that we can not override their styling with a cess framework).
